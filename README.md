# Sunbird Obsrv

_Obsrv_ as a Sunbird building block comprises of several components that come together to enable the ability to measure and observe various actions and activities carried out by the system/ users. _Obsrv_ can be utilised as an independent building block that allows for measurement, or as part of a system that employs different Sunbird blocks to enable  various workflows.&#x20;

It offers powerful data processing and aggregation infrastructure to process telemetry data generated by users & systems, validate the data, as well as aggregate and generate insights. It also has built-in open data cataloging and publishing capability. It is built keeping extensibility in mind, so that adopters have the flexibility to adapt the telemetry and tools to their specific use-cases.

**OVERVIEW**

Sunbird allows for generation and consumption of usage data in order to be able to carry out any required analysis. The data flow on the platform is as illustrated below.



![Sunbird data flow](<.gitbook/assets/data flow (1).png>)

All the client apps and micro services within Sunbird/ _otherwise_ are instrumented to generate Telemetry data to capture usage and various actions which can be used to derive insights. The data pipeline will process the Telemetry event stream data in near real-time by application of a series of validation, de-duplication, transformation and denormalization steps. The Telemetry data is synced at various points in the data pipeline to a configurable cloud storage which acts as the persistent data storage.

A generic summarized dataset is generated from the Telemetry data using a heuristic algorithm which will comprise of commonly used summaries such as session summary. The summarized dataset is an aggregated dataset which can be used to generate custom derived datasets required for custom workflows.

The summarized stream of data is also merged into the data pipeline. Custom data products can be generated from these streams of data to derive insights.

The event data streams can be synced to an analytic data store to build a access layer to the data sets. The adopters are free to choose any analytics data store and/or visualisation tools (Sunbird supports Druid and Superset out-of-the-box)of their choice to build canned reports and dashboards to slice and dice the data.

Sunbird Obsrv is a combination of various tools which provide the capabilities such as streaming, processing and storage of telemetry data and deriving reporting insights from the data.
