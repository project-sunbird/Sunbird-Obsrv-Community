# Data Pipeline

Group of real-time stream processing jobs that processes the event stream of telemetry data generated from client apps and micro services. The telemetry data goes through a series of steps such as validation, deduplication, transformation and denormalisation of metadata. The transformed data is then stored in a consumable format that can be used for further analysis.
