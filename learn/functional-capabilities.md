# Functional Capabilities

<mark style="color:orange;">\<Lead-in from Overview></mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">Key Capabilities:</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**Observe What Matters**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">: Derive insights to understand user behaviour and preferences, improve products, etc. by capturing user interaction & system data according to flexible specifications defined by you.</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**Seamless Data Transfer**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">: Stream and store the telemetry data efficiently using an out-of-the-box design that decouples data generation systems from the data processing systems.</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**Scalable Data Processing:**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">Perform real-time data processing i.e. cleaning & transforming according to reporting needs, with addition of metadata of various entities such as user, device and content.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">**Readymade Key Metrics**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">: Derive insights quickly, from pre-defined summary metrics such as time spent in a session, time spent on a content etc.</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**Easy Reporting and Querying**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">: perform advanced analytics & reporting in near real-time by running queries on both the telemetry data and summarized data that is loaded into an analytics data store.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">The following are the details of the functional capabilities enabled using Sunbird Obsrv:</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**Flexible Data Model Specification:**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">The Telemetry data model is designed to instrument telemetry data (interactions, metrics and logs) for any domain.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Data collection at scale:**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">Perform seamless telemetry data collection from client apps using horizontally scalable api.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Easy integration with Cloud providers:**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">The analytics platform can be easily deployed onto any of the popular cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Streaming/Batch data processing:**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">The analytics platform provides an ability to process both real-time streaming data and batch data to derive insights.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Build fast, scalable data analytics:**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">The analytics platform is designed to build ad-hoc analytics or recurring reports in a fast, scalable manner.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Downloadable data:**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">The analytics platform provides an ability to download both the raw data and aggregated data through the reporting api also with an ability to schedule recurring reporting requirements.</mark>

Some additional possibiities that can be visualised using Sunbird Obsrv include:

* Allowing for `capture of telemetry` as per chosen specifications from an agricultural monitoring system, and `processing and analysis of the resulting data` to optimise output
* Aggregation of anonymised health data from across platforms, and its `analysis` to arrive at health indicators and patterns at population scale.&#x20;
* Analysis of `streams of weather data` from satellites to better `predict` weather patterns.
